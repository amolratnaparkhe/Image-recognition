# End-to-end Image classifier project(Failed!)
I have used Tensorflow 2.0 library to employ the convolutional neural networks(CNNs) and the objective of this project is to classify the images of dogs, cats, deers, and bunnies. 
I'll go through all the details about how to work with the convolutional neural netwroks using TF 2.0 and the obstacles I've come across!
I'm going to write more on why I feel that thi project has failed but the most important reason as of now I could think of is NOT ENOUGTh DATA!
